# ðŸš¨ IMMEDIATE FIX for "Network request failed" Error

## âœ… What I Fixed:

1. **Fixed Redirect URI Mismatch** - Updated `auth0Config.ts` to use `lakbaimobile://auth` (matches your logs)

## ðŸ”¥ What You Need to Do NOW:

### **Step 1: Start Your PHP Backend Server**
```bash
cd /workspace/LakbAI-API
php -S 0.0.0.0:8000 -t .
```

If PHP isn't installed, use Python as temporary server:
```bash
cd /workspace/LakbAI-API
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

### **Step 2: Test the Fix**
1. Start the server above
2. Test your Auth0 login again
3. The token exchange should now work!

## ðŸŽ¯ Root Cause:
Your mobile app was trying to reach `http://192.168.254.110:8000/LakbAI-API/routes/auth0.php` but the server wasn't running. 

**That's it!** Start the server and try authentication again. ðŸš€
